## üõ†Ô∏è Local Setup Instructions (Recommended)
The best way to recreate your successful Kaggle environment is to use the Conda package manager, as it handles faiss-gpu and pytorch correctly.

Install Conda: If you don't have it, install Miniconda or Anaconda.

Create a Conda Environment: Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt and run:

Bash

conda create -n llm_project python=3.11 -y
conda activate llm_project
Install GPU Libraries with Conda: This is the most crucial step.

Bash

conda install -c pytorch faiss-gpu=1.7.4 pytorch=2.3.0 torchvision=0.18.0 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -y
Install Remaining Packages with Pip: Now, install all the other libraries from your requirements.txt file.

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to Run Your Project
Place Documents: Put your .pdf and .docx files inside the your-llm-project/retrieval_engine/documents/ folder.

Create the Vector Store: Open your terminal, activate the conda environment (conda activate llm_project), navigate to your project folder, and run the ingestion script once.

Bash

python retrieval_engine/main.py
Get an Answer: Run the main application script to ask a question.

Bash

python llm_application/app.py
